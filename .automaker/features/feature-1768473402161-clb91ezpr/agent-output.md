I'll help you implement error boundary components for your application.

 Let me start by exploring the codebase to understand the existing structure.

I can see this is a React/Next.js project called "Notimanager".

*This is a Swift/macOS application, not a React/Next.js app!

 I can see this is a macOS application with Swift files (.

swift), using SwiftUI or AppKit.

 Let me understand the structure better and examine some key files to understand the current error handling approach and how to implement error boundaries in this context.

Since this is Swift/macOS, the concept of "error boundary components" from React doesn't directly apply, but I can implement similar error handling patterns using Swift's error handling mechanisms, custom error types, and user-friendly error displays.

Let me first examine some key files to understand the current architecture:
1.

 Main app file
2.

 Some view controllers
3.

 Error handling if any exists
4.

 Design system tokens</think>
